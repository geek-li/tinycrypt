Chaskey is a lightweight MAC algorithm optimised for 32-bit
micro-controllers. It is based on a 128-bit block cipher, the Chaskey
cipher, which uses ARX operations and an Even-Mansour structure. This
means that there is no key schedule: the 128-bit master key is XOR-ed,
then a public permutation is applied and then the master key is XOR-ed
again.

The code implementing it is very simple and similar to that of SipHash.

The original paper also suggests doubling the number of rounds of the
Chaskey cipher to obtain an even more secure primitive, Chaskey-LTS
(Long Time Support), with 16 rounds.
