SEA is a block cipher which can have an arbitrary block size n (as long as n=6b for some b), word size w and number of rounds nr. A complete description of the algorithm (round function and update of the key) is given on the figure on the right which comes from the original paper[69]. It is based on the following operations:

    Bitwise XOR
    Application of a S-box S. Interestingly, S is a 3x3 S-box.
    Rotation of the words in a vector of words
    Bit rotation inside a word
    Addition modulo 2b
