        Base64 encoding and decoding in x86/x64 assembly
        
[ intro

This project is entirely derived from the work of Peter Ferrie [1] and I 
don't claim to be the author. His implementation was so well written, I 
didn't believe it could be rewritten any better than what it currently 
is! 

32 and 64-bit functions are available.
